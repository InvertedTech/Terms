# Terms
Most NodeFoundation's project are GPL. However We carefully select and plan some project to be Permissive open-source licenses to encourage rapid commercialization and an ecosystem of providers to develop.

You can use any code or Symbol in NodeFoundation.org for your own venture and branding in any of your own projects or including commercial use, without written permission. As long as 3 terms are followed:

1. All outright Forks of NodeFoundation's code which establish a competing Entity or brand must be GPL License. In which we will change our upstream project to match yours. We consider these attempts to steer away from the core "vision & spirit" of the original founders.

2. GPL Forks do not need to mention NodeFoundation.

3. Any project which uses multipe repositories or libraries from us must have the same license as the "least restrictive" of repos it's borrowing code from.

3. Commercial projects can have a BSD MIT or a permissive license as long as you have a link back to NodeFoundation.org and the official Github or Social media in a prominent location (for ex. website Footer, or app "About" section)


4. You will sync your code to github.com/SrcGraph in a private repository after publication of your work. From which we will maintain a relationship & mentorship with you to help you reach your business goals.
